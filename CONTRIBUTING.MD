# Contributing
Thanks for your interest contributing to Twasi!

To get started, you need to get an instance of mongodb running locally. 
You can refer to the installation script in the "install" directory for that task.

Next you need to clone Twasi-Core in a directory of your choice. You may also clone it using your IDE.

Then just start the main file `net.twasi.core.Main`, adapt the config and you're ready to go.
