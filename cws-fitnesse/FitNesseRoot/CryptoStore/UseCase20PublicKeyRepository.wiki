!1 Public Key Repository

Some companies rely heavily on PGP (OpenPGP or GnuPG) for their communication,
either with e-mails or with attaching data in central systems like bug trackers,
ticketing systems, etc.

One problem for many, is that the recipients may change or keys may be updated.
Which means that often, there's loads of additional work with ensuring that
everybody have updated list of recipients and the correct keys.

CWS allows storing a Public Key for each member, and with the internal Circles,
it is possible to simply get a list of recipients and their keys from the CWS
server, and integrate these into a Client which will then encrypt data based on
these.
