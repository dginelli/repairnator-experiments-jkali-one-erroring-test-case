!1 Improving Messaging Apps

Many existing Messaging Apps, which is based on the Signal Algorithm have a
problem with control of the commonly shared symmetric key(s). They are designed
in a way, so the symmetric key used for encryption is stored with each client.

Generally, this is a good concept - keys should be stored closely to the users,
rather than centrally. However, the problem comes when groups exist, and someone
is removed from the group. The Signal client has all the data to read data from
the group stored on the device, which means that it is possible for them, via
the Signal API, to re-attach themselves to the Group, and thus read data again.

To improve the security, CWS can be used as part of the central storing of
information, as a member who has been removed, will also have been removed from
the central Group information. By using CWS, the person cannot be re-attached to
the Group as they do not have access to the Group Key.

The CWS API for Circles allows storing an externally controlled Symmetric Key,
which can be used to control things. The Key is stored encrypted with the Circle
Key, so it can only be extracted if someone has access to the Circle Key.
