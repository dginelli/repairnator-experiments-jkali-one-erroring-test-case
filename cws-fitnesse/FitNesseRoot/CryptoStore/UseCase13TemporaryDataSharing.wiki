!1 Temporary Data Sharing

If someone wishes to quickly share some data for reviewing, then it can be done
by quickly create a new Circle of Trust, and only assign the people who need to
see the data.

CWS allows members to create an infinite number of Circles, quickly and with
little fuss. Circles can also be dropped again, just as quickly. This will allow
someone to have a quick collaboration.

However, as with all other features - this is only allowed between CWS members,
it is not possible to share data to external parties, as the unlocking of data
requires access to the Keys, which also are stored encrypted.

Note; Extending this feature with the possibility to allow anonymous access to
the system is not impossible, but - it requires a new type of member account,
which again is possible, and something which can easily be part of a newer
version of CWS.
