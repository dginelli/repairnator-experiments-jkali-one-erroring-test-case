!1 Simple File Repository

Dropbox and other system allow users to store their data in a central location,
and with clients installed on all devices, it is possible to access these in a
simple, convenient way.

Problem is, encryption is more often than not - an add-on!

CWS can be used as such a central file repository. It doesn't care about what
data is stored, it simply looks a the bytes and nothings else. However, if CWS
is used for this purpose - MIMETypes must be added as so-called ''DataTypes'',
so the data is stored and retrieved with an additional information, which will
allow the data to be correctly read out.

Alternatively, if the Client understands all the MIMETypes used, the data can
be stored with a name that also contain the file extension.

CWS Allows the creation of Folders, and adding data to a folder, so it can be
organized in a sensible way - as the Member wishes.
