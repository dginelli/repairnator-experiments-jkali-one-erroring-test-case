/**
 * Compares the the original VCF and accession report VCF, and logs the differences.
 *
 * Terminology: The original VCF contains variants, and it will be loaded into the 'variant buffer'. The accession
 * report VCF contains the accessioned variants, and it will be loaded into the 'accession buffer'.
 *
 * The high-level idea of the process is filling those 2 buffers, and when the same coordinates appears in both the
 * variant buffer and the accession buffer, it means that the variant in those coordinates was correctly accessioned,
 * so it can be removed from both buffers. At the end, only variants without accessions and accessions without
 * variants should be left in the buffers after both files were completely read.
 *
 * The reason why the buffers are needed is that the accession report can be unordered. In order to avoid
 * having the VCFs completely loaded in memory, a buffer size can be configured for both buffers. However, to guarantee
 * correct behaviour in worst-ordering scenario, the buffers need to be able to grow indefinitely.
 *
 * To perform some self-checks, this tasklet provides the maximum size of the buffers during the execution, and
 * also provides the number of iterations needed.
