/**
 * An AMS packet can be transferred via RS232 with the help of an AMS serial frame.
 * The actual AMS packet is in the user data field of the frame.
 * The max. length of the AMS packet is limited to 255 bytes.
 * Therefore the max. size of an AMS serial frame is 263 bytes.
 * The fragment number is compared with an internal counter by the receiver.
 * The frame number is simply accepted and not checked when receiving the first AMS frame or in case a timeout is
 * exceeded. The CRC16 algorithm is used for calculating the checksum.
