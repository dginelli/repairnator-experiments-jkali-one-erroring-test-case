*Riptide: Timeout* adds timeout support to *Riptide*. It allows to set a *global* timeout to all remote requests
that will be covering any remote communication, socket timeouts and retries. 

## Example

```java
Http.builder()
    .plugin(new TimeoutPlugin(scheduler, 5, SECONDS))
    .build();
```

## Features

- adds global timeouts to Riptide calls

## Dependencies

- Java 8
- Riptide Core

## Installation

Add the following dependency to your project:

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.zalando</groupId>
    <artifactId>riptide-timeout</artifactId>
    <version>${riptide.version}</version>
</dependency>
```

## Configuration

```java
Http.builder()
    .plugin(new TimeoutPlugin(scheduler, 5, SECONDS))
    .build();
```

**Make sure**, that you order your plugins correctly when registering, so that the timeout is applied to everything
that you want it to. The `TimeoutPlugin` is usually registered as one of the last plugins.

## Usage

Given the timeout plugin was configured as shown in the last section: A regular call like the following will now be
timed out if it did not finish within 5 seconds:

```java
http.get("/users/me")
    .dispatch(series(),
        on(SUCCESSFUL).call(User.class, this::greet),
        anySeries().call(problemHandling()))
```

**Be aware** that the timeout will also include the runtime of the `greet` method or `problemHandling()` depending
on which one is being executed.
