                        H2MS is an application for keeping track of compliance activities
                        in clinical environments, initially aimed at providing a low-cost
                        solution to improve hand-hygiene compliance auditing in clinical
                        settings, and ultimately to significantly reduce the prevalence
                        of infections spread by hand-contacts. Hand hygiene monitoring
                        can be performed through a human observer using web-form on mobile
                        device, as well as automated recording through inexpensive microcontroller
                        devices using RFID or Bluetooth tags on hospital personnel.
                        In addition, the web-form can be easily modified by the administrator
                        of the H2MS to adapt to other monitoring tasks, such as glove and
                        mask compliance. Clinical staff can obtain feedback on their compliance
                        rating for individual improvement, and compliance officers use the collected
                        information to devise organizational improvement strategies. The system
                        is open-source, and can be modified to individual organizationâ€™s unique needs.
