We promised you more frequent releases, and here they are!
Although we said that this will be the last Alpha release for 1.2.0, we decided that we need another round since we couldn't get everything done yet for which we already had an API.
One of our main concerns was Java 9 compatibility related to split packages. So we moved a few things around and gave all modules proper Automatic-Module-Name manifest entries.
We also spent quite some time on supporting REST technologies and providing examples which, but it was worth it! Overall, we have quite a few nice features for you

* https://github.com/Blazebit/blaze-persistence/issues/323[*#323*, window="_blank"] Support for fetch strategies for non-correlated mappings
* https://github.com/Blazebit/blaze-persistence/issues/51[*#51*, window="_blank"] Add method to enable query result caching
* https://github.com/Blazebit/blaze-persistence/issues/450[*#450*, window="_blank"] Updatable attributes by default now allow all known subtypes that don't introduce cycles, rather than requiring the user to specify all allowed subtypes
* https://github.com/Blazebit/blaze-persistence/issues/209[*#209*, window="_blank"] Support for compiling and running on JDK 9 & 10 & 11-EA
* https://github.com/Blazebit/blaze-persistence/issues/538[*#538*, window="_blank"] Spring Data 2.0 and DeltaSpike 1.8 support
* https://github.com/Blazebit/blaze-persistence/issues/535[*#535*, window="_blank"] Spring Data Rest integration offering first class keyset pagination support
* https://github.com/Blazebit/blaze-persistence/issues/496[*#496*, window="_blank"] DeltaSpike Data Rest integration offering +++<!-- PREVIEW-SUFFIX --><!-- </p></li></ul></div> --><!-- PREVIEW-END -->+++ pagination support similar to what Spring Data offers
* https://github.com/Blazebit/blaze-persistence/issues/536[*#536*, window="_blank"] Support for positional parameters

and lots of bugfixes, most notably

* https://github.com/Blazebit/blaze-persistence/issues/417[*#417*, window="_blank"] `EntityViewManager` was wrongly passed to `@PostCreate` Java 8 default methods in interfaces
* https://github.com/Blazebit/blaze-persistence/issues/537[*#537*, window="_blank"] Fix illegal Entity-To-Association-Id rewrite
* https://github.com/Blazebit/blaze-persistence/issues/518[*#518*, window="_blank"], https://github.com/Blazebit/blaze-persistence/issues/519[*#519*, window="_blank"], https://github.com/Blazebit/blaze-persistence/issues/521[*#521*, window="_blank"] Fix a few problems that occur when using Hibernate specific features
* https://github.com/Blazebit/blaze-persistence/issues/514[*#514*, window="_blank"] Fix in cyclic join detection that happened when using multiple join nodes in ON clause

A big thanks is going out to Jan-Willem Gmelig Meyling for all the tests and fixes he provided in the last few weeks. We very much appreciate the contribution!

We advise you to update to 1.2.0-Alpha5 as soon as possible to prevent getting hit from the Entity-To-Association-Id rewrite issue https://github.com/Blazebit/blaze-persistence/issues/537[*#537*, window="_blank"].

There are a few features left that already have a partial implementation or are present in APIs that we are going to finish for the final release of 1.2.0.
For future versions, we intend to follow our time based release model more strictly.

Stay tuned, the final https://github.com/Blazebit/blaze-persistence/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+milestone%3A1.2.0[1.2.0 release] that was originally targeted for end of February is rescheduled for the end of April.
