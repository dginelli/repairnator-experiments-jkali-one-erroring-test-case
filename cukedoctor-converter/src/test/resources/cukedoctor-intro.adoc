= *Introduction*

Cukedoctor is a *Living documentation* tool which integrates Cucumber and Asciidoctor in order to convert your _BDD_ tests results into an awesome documentation.

Here are some design principles:

* Living documentation should be readable and highlight your software features;
** Most bdd tools generate reports and not a truly documentation.
* Cukedoctor *do not* introduce a new API that you need to learn, instead it operates on top of http://www.relishapp.com/cucumber/cucumber/docs/formatters/json-output-formatter[cucumber json output^] files;
** In the 'worst case' to <<Enrich-features,enhance>> your documentation you will need to know a bit of http://asciidoctor.org/docs/what-is-asciidoc/[asciidoc markup^].

In the subsequent chapters you will see a documentation which is generated by the output of https://github.com/rmpestano/cukedoctor/tree/master/cukedoctor-converter/src/test/java/com/github/cukedoctor/bdd/cukedoctor[Cukedoctor's BDD tests^], *a real bdd living documentation*.
