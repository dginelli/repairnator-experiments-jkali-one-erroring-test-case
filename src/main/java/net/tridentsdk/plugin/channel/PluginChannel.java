/**
 * Represents a message channel which can be opened by the
 * server or a client. This allows for custom communication
 * between plugins and the client, such as to allow mods to
 * interface across the network.
 *
 * <p>A plugin channel can be created using on of the
 * static {@code open} methods, and can be closed by
 * obtaining the instance of the channel such as through
 * {@link #get(String)} and then closing the channel, if it
 * exists.</p>
 *
 * <p>A plugin channel is implicitly closed when a player
 * leaves the server. In that case, the player will be
 * automatically removed from the plugin channel list of
 * recipients, and must be added again manually UNLESS
 * {@link #openAll(String)} was used, in which case the
 * player will be automatically added again once they join
 * the server.</p>
