== S7 Comm Plus (0x72)

The `S7 Comm Plus` protocol is a new version of the original `S7 Comm` protocol.
While a `S7 Comm` packet is identified, by the magic byte `0x32`, the `S7 Comm Plus` packet uses the magic byte `0x72`.
The End of a packet is indicated by a frame end sequence of 6 bytes: 00 00 72 01 00 00

The general structure of the protocols content however is completely different and far less documented.

The biggest source for getting started in implementing this protocol was the https://os-s.de/thesis/MA_Maik_Brueggemann.pdf[Master Thesis of Maik Br√ºggemann].
However this only covered the basic structure of a `S7 Comm Plus` packet.
