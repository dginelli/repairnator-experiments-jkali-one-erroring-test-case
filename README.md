# Gluon  [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/absa-subatomic/gluon.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/absa-subatomic/gluon) [![codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/absa-subatomic/gluon/branch/master/graph/badge.svg)](https://codecov.io/gh/absa-subatomic/gluon) [![Maintainability](https://api.codeclimate.com/v1/badges/b7ab83c942404ff6fa90/maintainability)](https://codeclimate.com/github/absa-subatomic/gluon/maintainability)

A supporting domain applying logic and emitting events to indicate indicate desired state.

> A gluon is an elementary particle that acts as the exchange particle for the strong force between quarks. It is analogous to the exchange of photons in the electromagnetic force between two charged particles. - [Wikipedia](https://g.co/kgs/tuyx3j)

## Development setup

To run Gluon locally using an in memory H2 database:

```console
$ ./mvnw spring-boot:run -pl nucleus -Dspring.profiles.active=local
```

### `local` Spring profile

The local Spring profile can be setup by following the instructions [here](nucleus/src/etc/atomist-config/README.md).
To successfully invoke the Atomist webhooks, you **must complete the steps above** before starting Gluon.

By default Gluon will be available at: http://localhost:8080

### Postman

There are Postman collections located in the `nucleus/src/etc/postman` directory.
These can be imported and used to test the available API resources.

See the Postman [reference documentation](https://www.getpostman.com/docs/postman/collections/data_formats)
for more information.

## Docker

To build a Docker image with a runnable build of Gluon, you can use the S2I tool.

### S2I

[Source-to-Image (S2I)](https://github.com/openshift/source-to-image)
is a toolkit and workflow for building reproducible Docker images from source code.

First install S2I by following the [Installation](https://github.com/openshift/source-to-image#installation)
instructions.

Then in the root directory of Gluon run:

```console
$ s2i build . absasubatomic/s2i-jdk8-maven3-subatomic subatomic-gluon --env ARTIFACT_DIR=nucleus/target
...
```

note the use of the `ARTIFACT_DIR` environment variable which is needed as Gluon is a multi module
Maven project. See the base [RHEL S2I Java builder image](https://github.com/fabric8io-images/s2i/tree/master/java/images/rhel#build-time)
for more information.

Alternatively, using the GitHub codebase, in any directory run:

```console
$ s2i build https://github.com/absa-subatomic/gluon.git absasubatomic/s2i-jdk8-maven3-subatomic subatomic-gluon --env ARTIFACT_DIR=nucleus/target
...
```

### Running the Docker image

Once the S2I build has completed, you can run Gluon with:

```console
$ docker run -p 8080 subatomic-gluon
...
```
